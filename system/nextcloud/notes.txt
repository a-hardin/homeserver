If you need to move files over from existing user 
if you have the folder (ex: Alan Phone)

Solution 1

create the new user as the previous system
ex: old system user was alan, the new systems user should be alan 

After the user is created copy the old folder into the new user's folder
This can be done my going into the docker container and navigating to where
you are storing nextclouds files. You will need root privilages do: sudo su 

once the folder is copied over. In the nextcloud app create a new folder with
name of the folder you just copied.

You might need to refresh after creating the folder but you should have your files
